Important Keypoints for Networking
-----------------------------------

### What is a network?
A computer network is a group of interconnected devices that are designed to communicate and share information with each other.

### Uses of computer networks
1. Resource Sharing
2. Communication
3. Information Access
4. Centralized management
5. Remote Access

### Types of networks
1. Local Area Network (LAN)
2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
3. Wide Area Network (WAN)
4. Personal Area Network (PAN)

### Network Topologies
A network topology refers to how devices are connected in a network.

1. Bus
2. Ring
3. Star
4. Mesh
5. Tree
6. Hybrid

### OSI Model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework for understanding how computer networks work.
It is composed of seven layers, each of which serves a specific purpose in the communication process.

### TCP/IP Model
The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is a widely used networking model that provides a framework for communication over the internet.
It is composed of four layers, each with its own set of protocols and functions.

### Network Devices
These are physical devices that allow hardware on a computer network to communicate and interact with one another.
Example: Hub, Switch, Router, etc.

### Network Protocols
Network protocols define how data is transmitted, received, and processed between devices.
They are essential for ensuring that devices can communicate with each other.

### Wireless Networks
A wireless network is a type of computer network that uses radio waves instead of physical cables to connect devices.
Wireless networks are commonly used for internet access, as well as for sharing files, printers, and other resources between devices.
