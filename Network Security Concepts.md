# Network Security Concepts

Network Security is the operation of protecting data, applications, devices, and systems that are connected to the network.
Network security involves the practices, policies, and technologies implemented to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and resources within a computer network.
Network Security focuses on two core concepts: authentication and authorisation


## Authentication - 
- validating the authenticity of something or someone.
  
- Authentication is the process of proving that you are who you say you are

## Authorisation - 
- It is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources
  
- Authorization is the process of giving someone the ability to access a resource.
 

## Base Network Security Control Levels:
- **Physical** -	Physical security controls prevent unauthorised physical access to networking devices, cable boards, locks, and all linked components.

- **Technical** -	Data security controls prevent unauthorised access to network data, like installing tunnels and implementing security layers.

- **Administrative** -	Administrative security controls provide consistency in security operations like creating policies, access levels and authentication processes.


## The main approaches:

**Access Control**

The starting point of Network Security. It is a set of controls to ensure authentication and authorisation. 	

**Threat Control**

Detecting and preventing anomalous/malicious activities on the network. It contains both internal (trusted) and external traffic data probes.


## The key elements of Access Control:

**Firewall Protection**	

Controls incoming and outgoing network traffic with predetermined security rules. Designed to block suspicious/malicious traffic and application-layer threats while allowing legitimate and expected traffic.

**Network Access Control (NAC)**	

Controls the devices' suitability before access to the network. Designed to verify device specifications and conditions are compliant with the predetermined profile before connecting to the network.

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)**	

Controls and manages the asset identities and user access to data systems and resources over the network.

**Load Balancing**	

Controls the resource usage to distribute tasks over a set of resources and improve overall data processing flow.

**Network Segmentation**	

Creates and controls network ranges and segmentation to isolate the users' access levels, group assets with common functionalities, and improve the protection of sensitive/internal devices/data in a safer network.

**Virtual Private Networks (VPN)**	

Creates and controls encrypted communication between devices over the network 

**Zero Trust Model**	

Suggests configuring and implementing the access and permissions at a minimum level. The mindset is focused on: "Never trust, always verify".



## The key elements of Threat Control:

**Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDS/IPS)**	

Inspects the traffic and creates alerts (IDS) or resets the connection (IPS) when detecting an anomaly/threat.

**Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**	

Inspects the traffic and blocks the extraction of sensitive data.

**Endpoint Protection**	

Protecting all kinds of endpoints and appliances that connect to the network by using a multi-layered approach like encryption, antivirus, antimalware, DLP, and IDS/IPS.

**Cloud Security**	

Protecting cloud/online-based systems resources from threats and data leakage by applying suitable countermeasures like VPN and data encryption.

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**	

Technology that helps threat detection, compliance, and security incident management, through available data (logs and traffic statistics) by using event and context analysis to identify anomalies, threats, and vulnerabilities.

**Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR)**	

Technology that helps coordinate and automates tasks between various people, tools, and data within a single platform to identify anomalies, threats, and vulnerabilities. It also supports vulnerability management, incident response, and security operations.

**Network Traffic Analysis & Network Detection and Response**	

Inspecting network traffic or traffic captured to identify anomalies and threats.
