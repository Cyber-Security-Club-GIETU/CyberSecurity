## Cyber Security Fundamentals
-------------------------------
### What is Cyber Security?
It's about protecting your computer systems, networks, and data from being hacked, stolen, or damaged by cybercriminals who try to break in and cause trouble.

### What is Information Security?
It is the act of protecting data and information from unauthorized access, modification, corruption, disclosure and destruction.

What is Information Systems Security?
It is the process of protecting the systems that hold and process the critical data and information

### CIA Triad
------------
Confidentiality 
----------------------
Information is only accesssible by authorized users
keeping information secret

Why is it important - protect personal privacy, maintain business advantage, regulatory compliance

Ways to implement - Encryption, Access Controls, Data Masking, Physical secuirty, training and awareness

Confidentiality = Encryption

Integrity
------------
Data remains accurate and unaltered unless modification is required
verifies the accuracy and trustworthiness of data

Why is it important - Ensure data accuracy, maintain trust, ensure system operability

Ways to implement - Hashing, Digital signatures, checksums, access controls, regular audits

Integrity = Hashing

Availability
----------------
Information and resources are accessible when needed by authorized users


Need for availability - Ensure business continuity, maintain customer trust, upholding an organisation's trust

How to achieve - Redundancy (Server, Data, Network, Power)

Availability = Redundancy

### Non-repudiation
-----------------
specific action or event that has taken place can not be denied by the parties involved
undeniable proof of digital transactions

Importance - Confirming Authenticity of Digital Transactions, Ensuring  Integrity, Providing Accountability

Non-Repudiation = Digital Signatures

### AAA
-----
Authentication
---------------
process of verifying the identity of a user or a system
verifying that the individuals or entities are who they claim to be during a communication

Authentication Methods - Something You know, Something You Have, Something you are, Something you do, somewhere you are

2FA and MFA

Need for authentication - Prevent unauthorized access, protect user data and privacy, ensure resource validity

Authorization
--------------
what actions or resources a user can access
permissions or privileges  granted to users  or entities after they have been authenticated

Need - Protect sensitive data, maintain system integrity, create more streamlined user experience


Accounting
-------------
tracking user activities and resource usage and recording them

Accounting provied - Transparency, Security, Accountability

To perform accounting, we use - Syslog servers, network analysis tools, SIEMs


### What are security controls?
Measures or mechanisms used to mitigate risks and protect the CIA of information systems and data

### Zero Trust
------------
Security model that operates on the principle that no one, whether inside or outside the organization, should be trusted by default


### Threat 
---------
Anything that could cause harm, loss, damage, or compromise to IT systems
Sources of threat - Natural disasters, Cyber Attacks, Data Breaches, Disclosure of Confidential information


### Vulnerability
-----------------
Any weakness in the system design or implementation
examples - software bugs, misconfigured software, improperly protected network devices, missing security patches, lacking physical security

### Risk
-------
risk is the potential of an organization experiencing a cyber attack or data breach

Threat + No Vulnerability = No risk
Vulnerability + No Threat = No risk
Threat + vulnerability = Risk

### Risk  Analysis
--------------
evaluation of risk posed by vulnerabilities to  a specific organization
assessment of the likelihood of attacks, identify likely types of threat actors, evaluate the impact of successful exploits

### Risk Management
----------------
The process used to select security controls for an organization
part of an ongoing organisation-wide information security program
involves processes used to manage risk to the organization and the individuals associated with it.

### Asset Management
--------------------
involves the implementation of systems that track the location and configurations of networked devices and software across the organization


### Vulnerability Assessment
------------------------
finding out vulnerabilities in software and systems

### Penetration Testing
--------------------
simulated attacks to test the strength of network security and other security measures

### Vulnerability Management
--------------------------
it's about identifying and fixing weaknesses or flaws in your computer systems, software, or networks that hackers could exploit to break in and cause harm. 
This process involves scanning for vulnerabilities, assessing their potential impact, prioritizing which ones to fix first, and then taking action to patch or mitigate them before cybercriminals can take advantage of them

Gap Analysis
--------------
process of evaluating the difference between an organization's current performance and its desired performance
-> Technical gap Analysis
-> Business Gap Analysis
