# Network Traffic Analysis
Network traffic analysis is a comprehensive technique used to monitor, examine, and analyze network traffic.
Network traffic analysis involves examining the data packets that travel over a network. This analysis can be done in real-time or on captured data to understand the nature, origin, and destination of the traffic.

## Everyday use case of NTA:
• Collecting real-time traffic within the network to analyze upcoming threats.
• Setting a baseline for day-to-day network communications.
• Identifying and analyzing traffic from non-standard ports, suspicious hosts, and issues with networking protocols such as HTTP errors, problems with TCP, or other networking misconfigurations.
• Detecting malware on the wire, such as ransomware, exploits, and non-standard interactions.
• NTA is also useful when investigating past incidents and during threat hunting.

## NTA Workflow:-
1. Ingest Traffic
2. Reduce Noise by Filtering
3. Analyze and Explore
4. Detect and Alert


## Types:
1. Descriptive Analysis - It describes data set based on individual characterstics
2. Diagnostics Analysis - It clarifies the causes, effects and interactions of conditions. It provides insights those are obtained through correlations and interpretations
3. Predictive Analysis - It evaluates the historic and current data, and creates a predictive model for future probabilities
4. Prescriptive Analysis - It is the mixture of all analysis

## Tools and techniques used:
1. Packet Analyzers (Wireshark, tshark, tcpdump, windump)
2. Flow Analysis Tools (NetFlow for IP traffic info and monitoring)
3. Network Monitoring and IDS (Snort, Suricata, Zeek)
4. Visualization and Analysis (Splunk, ELK Stack, Wazuh)
