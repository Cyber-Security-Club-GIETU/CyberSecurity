# Cyber Threats

# 1. Malware
Malware, short for malicious software, is designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. There are several types of malware:
	• Viruses: Malicious code that attaches to clean files and spreads to other clean files. They can delete files, corrupt systems, and steal data.
	• Worms: Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks, exploiting vulnerabilities without human intervention.
	• Trojans: Malware disguised as legitimate software. Users are tricked into loading and executing the malware on their systems.
	• Ransomware: Encrypts data on a victim's computer and demands a ransom to restore access. It can cripple businesses by rendering critical data unusable.
	• Spyware: Secretly monitors user activity and gathers information without consent, often used to collect personal information or track browsing habits.
	• Adware: Automatically displays or downloads advertising material, sometimes in the form of a spyware that tracks users.
	
# 2. Phishing
Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker masquerades as a trusted entity, typically via email, to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information.
	• Spear Phishing: A more targeted form of phishing where attackers tailor their messages to a specific individual or organization.
	• Whaling: A type of phishing that targets high-profile individuals like executives within an organization.
	
# 3. Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks
DoS and DDoS attacks aim to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic.
	• DoS Attack: An attack from a single source attempting to disrupt the service.
	• DDoS Attack: An attack from multiple sources distributed across the globe, making it more difficult to mitigate.
	
# 4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
MitM attacks occur when an attacker secretly intercepts and relays messages between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. This can happen through various methods, including:
	• Eavesdropping: Intercepting communication to steal data.
	• Session Hijacking: Taking control of a user session after successfully obtaining session credentials.
	
# 5. SQL Injection
SQL injection involves inserting malicious SQL queries into a database input field, enabling attackers to view or manipulate the database. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, data corruption, or deletion.

# 6. Zero-Day Exploits
Zero-day exploits occur when attackers exploit a vulnerability in software that is unknown to the software vendor or not yet patched. These vulnerabilities can be sold on the black market and can cause significant damage before a fix is released.

# 7. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
APTs are prolonged and targeted cyberattacks in which an intruder gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period. The goal is usually to steal data rather than cause damage. They often involve sophisticated techniques and multiple phases:
	• Initial Access: Gaining entry into the network via phishing, malware, or exploiting vulnerabilities.
	• Establishing Foothold: Installing backdoors or other tools to maintain access.
	• Escalating Privileges: Gaining higher-level permissions.
	• Internal Reconnaissance: Mapping the internal network and identifying valuable data.
	• Lateral Movement: Moving through the network to reach targets.
	• Data Exfiltration: Transferring data out of the network.
	• Covering Tracks: Removing evidence of the attack to remain undetected.
	
# 8. Insider Threats
Insider threats come from individuals within the organization, such as employees, contractors, or business partners. These threats can be malicious or inadvertent:
	• Malicious Insider: Intentionally harm the organization by stealing data, corrupting systems, or sabotaging operations.
	• Unintentional Insider: Negligent actions that inadvertently expose the organization to risk, such as falling for phishing scams or misconfiguring security settings.
# 9. Credential Stuffing
Credential stuffing involves attackers using lists of breached username/password pairs to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. Since many people reuse passwords across multiple sites, attackers exploit this by trying credentials on various services.
# 10. IoT Attacks
The Internet of Things (IoT) involves connecting everyday devices to the internet. These devices often lack robust security, making them attractive targets for attackers. Common IoT threats include:
	• Botnets: Networks of infected IoT devices used to launch DDoS attacks.
	• Privacy Invasion: Unauthorized access to sensitive data collected by IoT devices.
	• Device Hijacking: Taking control of IoT devices to disrupt operations or launch attacks on other systems.
# 11. Social Engineering
Social engineering involves manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information. Common tactics include:
	• Pretexting: Creating a fabricated scenario to steal someone's information.
	• Baiting: Offering something enticing to entice victims into disclosing information or compromising systems.
	• Quid Pro Quo: Offering a benefit in exchange for information.
# 12. Cryptojacking
Cryptojacking occurs when attackers hijack a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrency. This can happen via malicious scripts on websites or malware installed on devices, leading to decreased performance and increased wear and tear on hardware.
